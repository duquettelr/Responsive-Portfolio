                    My name is Lindsey Duquette and I am currently a student at Harvard Extension School’s coding
                    bootcamp.

                </p>
                <p class="p2">

                    In 2013 I graduated from Quinnipiac University in Connecticut with a bachelor’s degree in Health
                    Sciences.
                    I then attended Northeastern University for graduate school where I earned a professional doctoral
                    degree
                    in Physical Therapy. Post-graduation, I worked in the field of physical therapy for two years but
                    did
                    not
                    feel fulfilled by my career. The aspects of my job that I enjoyed the most included working with
                    technology
                    and software, which sparked my interest in computer science.

                </p>
                <p>

                    At that point, I began taking night courses at schools including Boston University and Quincy
                    College to
                    learn
                    more about software development. After approximately one year of taking courses and learning various
                    programming
                    languages on my own including Python, C and SQL I accepted a position working as a Quality Assurance
                    Engineer. Through
                    this program at Harvard Extension School I hope to eventually earn a position working as a front-end
                    developer.
